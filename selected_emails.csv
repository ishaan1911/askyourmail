I'd blow it off.  Your batting 0.9999999999.  In anybody's book, that's 
phenomenal.  Don't look back.  And PR, under the circumstances, is doing a 
stellar job overall.  Vacation was nice.  Thanks.  Bad thing is it made me 
realize how much more of it I need (and likely ain't gonna get soon).

Best,
Jeff

That's what I told AP, but after I looked like a major doofus on the front 
page of the Chronicle... The last few weeks have not been pretty for PR...  
How was your vacation?

Seems to have Riordan written all over it.  I say ""no big deal.""  We're 
talking to everyone.  No secrecy involved.  We'll keep talking, being 
constructive and trying to help develop solutions that work for CA.   Your

Sara, I am forwarding this to you because as you will notice your last name

working in general on ISDA agreements between Enovate and third parties.

This website is offered by the Tourism Authority of Thailand.  I took a look
